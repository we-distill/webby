This is a Typescript project. 

If you don't have node / npm set up, you can use [Bun](https://bun.sh) as well.

> Optional step: run `nvm use` to use the expected `Major` version of `Node.js`

1. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

1. Run it:
    ```bash
    npx tsx index.ts https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift
    open output/Taylor_Swift.html
    ```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.1.4.
